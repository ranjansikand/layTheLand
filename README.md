Lay the Land

This is a quick game jam submission that I spent a Saturday morning on. 

The theme was "Reverse," so this is a game with two layers of reversal:
  1. It's a reverse of the platformer genre, with the player controlling the platforms instead of the character.
  2. The character's position is "reversed" back to the start every few seconds.

I had a itch to make a game that required some level design, plus physics puzzles are always fun! This game contains 20 levels and a "Sandbox" mode to play around with all of the different objects I created.
